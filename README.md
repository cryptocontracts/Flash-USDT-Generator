## 🌟 What is USDT Flashing?

**USDT flashing** is a simulated transaction technique that creates temporary USDT balances in wallets. These transactions appear valid but are ultimately non-settled due to blockchain limitations.

### How Flash USDT Works:

✅ **Phantom Balance Display** – Shows USDT in wallets but disappears on refresh  
✅ **Multi-Network Support** – Works on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Tron  
✅ **No Real USDT Transfers** – No liquidity, so it can't be swapped or sold  
✅ **Cold Wallet Transfers** – Can be moved across wallets before disappearing
